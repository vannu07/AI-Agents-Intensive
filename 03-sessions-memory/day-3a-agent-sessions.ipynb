It's one of the most impactful areas where AI is transforming healthcare. Here are some key new developments and ongoing trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is a major leap. Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models can *create entirely new molecules* from scratch that are optimized for specific targets and desired properties (e.g., binding affinity, low toxicity, good bioavailability).\n    *   **Examples:** Companies are using techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to design novel drug candidates.\n*   **\"Dreaming Up\" Drugs:** AI is being used to explore vast chemical spaces that are otherwise impossible for humans to navigate, potentially uncovering entirely new classes of drugs.\n\n**2. Advanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n*   **Uncovering New Disease Mechanisms:** AI can analyze complex biological data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, clinical data) to identify novel disease targets that were previously unknown or poorly understood.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are getting better at predicting whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning whether it's feasible to design a molecule that can effectively interact with it.\n\n**3. Enhanced Predictive Modeling for Efficacy and Toxicity:**\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI significantly speeds up the screening of millions of potential drug compounds against disease targets, identifying the most promising candidates for further lab testing. This reduces the time and cost associated with traditional high-throughput screening.\n*   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI models are becoming more accurate at predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates early in the discovery process. This helps filter out molecules likely to fail in later stages due to poor pharmacokinetic profiles or safety concerns.\n*   **Reduced Animal Testing:** By improving in silico prediction, AI aims to reduce the reliance on animal testing, which is ethically and financially burdensome.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Patient Stratification:**\n*   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI can analyze historical clinical trial data to identify patterns that predict the likelihood of success for new trials, helping companies make better investment decisions.\n*   **Optimizing Trial Protocols:** AI can help design more efficient clinical trial protocols, including determining optimal dosage, patient selection criteria, and endpoints.\n*   **Identifying Patient Subgroups:** AI can identify specific subgroups of patients who are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and successful trials, and eventually, more personalized medicine.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze vast databases of approved drugs and disease information to identify existing medications that might be effective for treating different conditions. This is a faster and often less risky path to new therapies.\n\n**6. AI for Protein Folding and Structure Prediction:**\n*   **Understanding Drug Interactions:** While DeepMind's AlphaFold is a landmark achievement, AI continues to advance in predicting the 3D structures of proteins. Knowing a protein's structure is crucial for designing drugs that can bind to it effectively.\n\n**7. Data Integration and Management:**\n*   **Handling Big Data:** Drug discovery generates enormous amounts of data. AI is essential for organizing, integrating, and making sense of these diverse datasets from various sources.\n\n**Key Companies and Initiatives:**\n\nMany biotech and pharmaceutical companies, as well as specialized AI-driven drug discovery firms, are at the forefront. Some prominent names include:\n\n*   **Big Pharma:** Companies like Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca, and Merck are heavily investing in and partnering with AI companies.\n*   **AI-Native Drug Discovery Companies:** Atomwise, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Insilico Medicine, BenevolentAI, Schrödinger, and many others are built around AI-driven drug discovery platforms.\n*   **Academic Research:** Universities are also making significant contributions to the fundamental research behind AI in drug discovery.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advances, challenges persist:\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation in the lab.\n*   **Data Quality and Access:** The performance of AI heavily relies on the quality and availability of data.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a certain prediction can sometimes be challenging.\n*   **Regulatory Hurdles:** Getting AI-discovered drugs through regulatory approval processes is a complex undertaking.\n\nIn summary, AI is fundamentally changing how drugs are discovered and developed, promising to accelerate the process, reduce costs, and lead to more effective and personalized treatments for a wide range of diseases.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **Advanced Target Identification and Validation**. This area is critical because finding the right \"target\" (usually a protein or gene involved in a disease process) is the very first step in designing a drug. If you aim at the wrong target, the drug won't work, no matter how well-designed it is.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is advancing target identification and validation:\n\n**What is Target Identification and Validation?**\n\n*   **Target Identification:** This is the process of discovering biological molecules (like proteins, enzymes, receptors, or genes) that play a key role in a disease. By interfering with the function of these molecules, a drug can potentially treat or prevent the disease.\n*   **Target Validation:** Once a potential target is identified, it needs to be \"validated.\" This means confirming with a high degree of certainty that the target is indeed involved in the disease and that modulating its activity will have a therapeutic benefit without causing unacceptable side effects.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing This Process:**\n\nAI excels at sifting through massive, complex, and often noisy datasets, which are abundant in biological and medical research. Here's how it's applied:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **What it is:** Researchers generate vast amounts of data from different \"omics\" – genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), etc.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI algorithms can integrate and analyze these disparate datasets simultaneously. They can identify subtle patterns and correlations that human researchers would likely miss. For example, AI might find that a specific combination of gene mutations (genomics) and altered protein levels (proteomics) is strongly associated with a particular disease phenotype.\n    *   **Outcome:** This helps pinpoint which specific biological pathways or molecules are dysregulated in disease states, serving as potential drug targets.\n\n2.  **Mining Scientific Literature and Databases:**\n    *   **What it is:** The body of scientific literature grows exponentially. It's impossible for any single researcher to keep up with all relevant publications.\n    *   **AI's Role:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models can \"read\" and understand millions of scientific papers, patents, and clinical trial reports. They can extract information about known drug-target interactions, disease mechanisms, and experimental results.\n    *   **Outcome:** AI can identify novel links between genes, proteins, diseases, and existing drugs that might suggest new therapeutic strategies and targets.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Patient Data (EHRs, Imaging):**\n    *   **What it is:** Electronic Health Records (EHRs), medical images, and real-world evidence from patient populations contain a wealth of information.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI can identify patient subpopulations with specific characteristics or disease trajectories. By correlating these with genetic or molecular data, AI can uncover targets specific to those subgroups. For example, AI might identify a protein that is overexpressed in patients who respond poorly to current treatments, making it a target for a new drug.\n    *   **Outcome:** This leads to the identification of more precise and personalized drug targets.\n\n4.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **What it is:** Not all disease-related molecules make good drug targets. A target is considered \"druggable\" if it's possible to design a small molecule or biologic that can bind to it with sufficient affinity and specificity, and thereby modulate its function.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI models can be trained on historical data of successful and unsuccessful drug targets. They can analyze the structural features, cellular location, and known interactions of a potential target to predict its likelihood of being druggable.\n    *   **Outcome:** This helps researchers prioritize which targets to pursue, saving time and resources by avoiding targets that are unlikely to yield a viable drug.\n\n5.  **Network Biology and Systems-Level Understanding:**\n    *   **What it is:** Diseases are rarely caused by the malfunction of a single molecule in isolation. They often involve complex interactions within biological networks.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI can model these complex biological networks, understanding how different components interact. This allows for the identification of \"bottleneck\" nodes or key regulators within these networks that, if targeted, could have a significant impact on the disease.\n    *   **Outcome:** This moves beyond a simplistic view of disease and helps identify more impactful intervention points.\n\n**Impact and Significance:**\n\n*   **Accelerated Discovery:** AI significantly speeds up the initial phase of drug discovery, which has traditionally been a bottleneck.\n*   **Higher Success Rates:** By improving target identification and validation, AI aims to increase the probability of drugs making it through clinical trials and reaching patients.\n*   **Novel Therapies:** AI's ability to uncover previously unknown targets opens doors to entirely new therapeutic approaches for diseases that are currently untreatable or poorly managed.\n*   **Personalized Medicine:** Identifying targets specific to patient subgroups is a crucial step towards developing highly personalized medicines.\n\nIn essence, AI is providing researchers with powerful new lenses to examine biological systems, uncovering insights into disease at a depth and scale previously unimaginable, and thereby finding the right biological \"levers\" to pull with new drugs.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies actively involved in using AI for **Target Identification and Validation**.

Academic Research Institutions:**\nMany leading universities and research institutes are at the forefront of developing novel AI methodologies for target identification and validation. They often publish their findings and may spin out companies or license their technologies.\n\n*   **MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Broad Institute:** These institutions consistently produce groundbreaking research in computational biology, genomics, and AI applications for medicine.\n\n**Key Trends in Company Strategies:**\n\n*   **Partnerships and Acquisitions:** Big Pharma is frequently partnering with or acquiring AI-native biotechs to gain access to their technology and expertise.\n*   **Platform-Based Approach:** Many AI companies are building comprehensive platforms that cover multiple stages of drug discovery, from target ID to molecule design.\n*   **Focus on Specific Disease Areas:** Some companies specialize in applying AI to target identification for specific diseases like oncology, neurodegenerative disorders, or rare genetic diseases.\n\nIt's important to note that the landscape is dynamic. New companies emerge, and existing ones evolve their strategies.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
