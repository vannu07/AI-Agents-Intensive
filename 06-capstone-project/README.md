# Capstone Project — Put It All Together

Overview:

- Build a production-ready agent that uses tools, memory, observability, and deployment.
- Suggested goals: a useful assistant with persistent memory, secure tools, tests, and CI/CD.

Starter checklist:

- Define user-facing capabilities and required tools.
- Design memory and session strategy.
- Add logging, metrics, and evaluation tests.
- Create a deployment plan (CI/CD, staging, rollback strategy).

Notes:

- Use the previous 5 days as a reference while building the capstone.
